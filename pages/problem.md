Over the past decade, oral cavity cancer rates have skyrocketed across the United States as a result of increased human papillomavirus (HPV) exposure and a lack of accessible diagnostic technologies. While oral cancer is largely treatable when caught early, nearly 70% of all cases are diagnosed in the later stages. The majority of these new oral cancer cases are clustered in low-income communities with heavily underfunded public health systems [Q3 INCOMPLETE]. 
Yet the existing solutions are prohibitively expensive for these individuals. OralVision's most significant competitors in the oral diagnostics market are the VELScope Vx and the ViziLite PRO Oral Lesion Screening System. These devices utilize blue light to excite fluorophore molecules in the mucous membrane, resulting in abnormal oral tissue emitting a distinct fluorescence. While these existing solutions have been successful in improving lesion visibility, they cannot accurately differentiate between benign and malignant growths and ultimately rely on the physician's naked eye to provide a specific diagnosis. Moreover, both the VELScope Vx and the ViziLite PRO can cost over $2,000 upfront, with necessary accessories bringing that price even higher. This exorbitant pricing alienates many clinics in underprivileged areas from accessing essential intraoral diagnostic technology, contributing to disproportionately high oral cavity cancer rates.
