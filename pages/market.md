[Q6 Market]
Physicians in low-income communities are our target audience. They generally lack the monetary resources required to purchase expensive intraoral diagnostic equipment for their clinics, resulting in frequent faulty diagnoses that undermine healthcare systems in these underserved communities. Our first testers will be local medical professionals, who will provide constructive feedback on our product. Then, we will expand our customer base to clinics in underserved communities across the nation to streamline logistics and ultimately spread worldwide. We hope that 10% of physicians in low-income communities in the US and 2.5% internationally adopt OralVision by 2030. In addition, we aspire to reach a cumulative revenue of $5,000,000 by the end of that year.
